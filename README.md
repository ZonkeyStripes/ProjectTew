    While everyone at the rich person cocktail studio apartment party was watching the game of thrones finale, or something relavent, the host, Frank Frankard, had been found dead! On the floor! Like right behind the couch!
    The guests: The Wife, a one eyed coworker, his brother, and the dog were unaware of his departure until you wanted a refill!

    "FRANK!! I don't know how to get ice out of your fridge!", as you turn around you find him lying on the floor!

    =====================================
    
    Apartment (Whats in it?)
        A fridge
        Cabinets(Closed/locked)
        Couch
        TV
        Coffee Table
        Single potted plant
        Closed Window
        Random Decor

        Co worker is killer, and used poisoned to kill host (frank). He got poison mixed up with his normal eyedrops, so he poisoned his eye which is why he needed the eye patch.

        Fiance's name is Penelope, the poisonous eye drops have a P on it, hinting P for penelope instead of P for poison when looking at the poisonous eye drops.
